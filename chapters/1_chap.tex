        \subsection*{Force-Time-Curve}\label{sec:A1 force time curve}% A1
        %
            In fig. 4 the force-time-diagram is subdivided into the following 8 parts:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item The ring is located above the interface. No force is caused.
                \item The ring touches the interface, creating a small positive adhesive force between the ring and the surface.
                \item The ring is about to penetrate the surface while the surface tension creates a small negative force.
                \item The ring is now immersed. Its wires produce a small positive force.
                \item When diving upwards, the force gradually increases.
                \item The ring breaks through the interface and induces an ever-increasing force.
                \item The force reaches its maximum.
                \item The force decreases a bit with the raising until the lamella collapses.
            \end{enumerate}
            If the diagram is compared with that in fig. 14, some differences are noted. For example, there are small
            periodic vibrations that probably have to do with the fluctuation of the ring and other external influences.
            It is particularly noticeable that after penetrating the surface, the force does not rise again into the
            positive, but remains in the negative and only returns into the positive from step 6. Otherwise, from a
            qualitative point of view, everything is similar to that in fig. 4, except that after the lamella has
            collapsed, the force oscillates around the zero position.

        \subsection*{Surface Tension Formula}\label{sec:A2 derive eq.4}% A2
        %
            The changing Area $ \Delta A $ corresponds to the inner plus outer circumference $ r_i $ and $ r_a $ of
            the ring multiplied by the changing height $ \Delta x $:
            \begin{align}
                \Delta A = 2\pi \cdot (r_i + r_a) \cdot \Delta x
            \end{align}
            Since the diameter $ D = 2R $ of the ring is much longer than the thickness $ t = r_a - r_i $, it can be assumed
            that the inner and outer circumferences are equal. It results:
            \begin{equation}
                \begin{gathered}
                    2R \gg r_a-r_i \quad \Rightarrow \quad r_i \approx r_a \approx R \\
                    \Leftrightarrow \\
                    \Delta A = 4\pi \cdot R \cdot \Delta x
                \end{gathered}
            \end{equation}
